Title: Calculate Interval-Based Marginal Effects
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author@R:
    person("Bodo", "Burger", email = "bododata@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Splits the feature space into several intervals of similar
    marginal effects. This improves the validity when calculating Average Marginal
    Effects on non-linear and/or non-monotonic response functions.
    Further, it helps the interpretation of feature effect plots (PDP, ICE, ALE).
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5.2)
